# garden_app
a portfolio app meant to help me with full stack development as well as a resource to help make gardening more organized for me.

Skills included in this project:
HTML5, CSS3, and Bootstrap
Javascript
PostgreSQL
Express
React
Node
Authentication & Authorization with JWT

Things that still need to be improved:
- add a section detailing which plants are included in the database
- add functionality to login in with other parties (Google, X, etc)
